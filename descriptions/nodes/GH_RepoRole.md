## Description

Represents a repository-level permission role. Each repository has five default roles (Read, Write, Admin, Triage, Maintain) plus any custom repository roles defined at the organization level. Repo roles define what actions a user or team can perform on a specific repository. Default roles form an inheritance hierarchy (Triage → Read, Maintain → Write, Admin includes all), and custom roles inherit from one of the base roles.
