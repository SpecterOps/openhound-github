## General Information

The traversable `GH_SyncedTo` edge is a hybrid edge that maps an external IdP user to a GitHub user based on SCIM provisioning. This edge represents a confirmed identity linkage between an external identity provider and GitHub. It is traversable because compromising the IdP account provides a verified path to the corresponding GitHub account, making it a critical edge for cross-system attack path analysis. This edge enables analysts to trace access from enterprise identity providers like Azure AD, Okta, or PingOne into the GitHub environment.
