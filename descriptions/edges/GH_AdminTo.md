# GH_AdminTo

## General Information

The traversable GH_AdminTo edge represents a role's full administrative access to the repository. Admin is the highest built-in repository role and grants control over all repository settings, including dangerous operations like deleting the repository or modifying its visibility. Admin access bypasses most protections including branch protection rules, unless `enforce_admins` is explicitly enabled on the branch protection rule. This edge is a key permission in the computed branch access model and is a high-value target in attack path analysis.
