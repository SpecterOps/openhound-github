# GH_HasSecret

## General Information

The traversable GH_HasSecret edge represents the relationship between a repository or environment and the secrets accessible within that context. Canonical all/private organization-secret availability is factored through a GH_Scope; selected organization secrets and repository/environment secrets remain direct. This edge is traversable because any principal that can execute a workflow in the relevant context may be able to exfiltrate secret values at runtime, making this a meaningful link in attack path analysis.

## Edge Schema

| Source | Destination | Traversable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GH_Environment` | `GH_EnvironmentSecret` | `true` |
| `GH_Repository` | `GH_OrgSecret` | `true` |
| `GH_Repository` | `GH_RepoSecret` | `true` |
| `GH_Repository` | `GH_Scope` | `true` |
